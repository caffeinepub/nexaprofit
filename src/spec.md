# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the selected “Minimum Investment” pricing range text to display exactly “$51 - $200”.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the displayed text of the single selected UI element at XPath `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/section[5]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/div[2]/div[2` to exactly: `$51 - $200`.

**User-visible outcome:** In the Pricing section, the selected “Minimum Investment” value renders exactly as “$51 - $200”, with no other text changes elsewhere.
