  "summary": "Implemented a new My Profile page and wired it into the protected hash-router with navigation from the Dashboard header. A frontend hook calls a new backend method name (`getCallerNumber`) to fetch a caller-derived unique number, but the diff summary does not provide evidence that the required backend query method is actually implemented in `backend/main.mo`, and the profile-page error-state rendering for unique-number load failures is not fully verifiable due to truncation.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Backend exposes a new query method that returns the caller’s stable, deterministic \"unique number\" derived from the caller principal.",
      "reason": "Frontend calls `actor.getCallerNumber()` but the provided `backend/main.mo` diff excerpt does not show any added `query` method (e.g., `getCallerNumber`) implementing deterministic principal-derived logic.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "My Profile page shows an English error state if the unique number cannot be loaded.",
      "reason": "`useGetCallerNumber` suppresses errors by catching and returning `null`, and while `MyProfilePage` captures `numberError`, the relevant UI rendering is truncated so it cannot be confirmed that an explicit English error state is shown when loading fails.",
