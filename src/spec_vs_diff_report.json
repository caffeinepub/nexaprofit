  "summary": "The diff implements post-sign-in dashboard navigation by wiring the HeroSection “Get Started” button to call `onOpenSignIn` with a success callback (`onNavigateToDashboard`). However, the BuildRequest constraint to apply changes ONLY to the element identified by the provided XPath cannot be verified from the diff, and multiple non-target files/utilities were modified.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply changes ONLY to the element identified by XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div[2]/button[1], and ensure no other buttons/elements outside that XPath have their behavior changed.",
      "reason": "The diff shows behavior-related wiring changes spanning multiple components (new props and callback plumbing), so the change is not isolated to a single, clearly-identifiable DOM element per the XPath constraint. The diff does not provide evidence mapping the modified Button to the specified XPath, nor does it prove no other elements were affected.",
