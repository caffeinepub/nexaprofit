  "summary": "The diff clearly implements an authenticated “Start Invest” in-app dialog flow wired through #/plans, but the evidence is truncated for parts of PricingSection, so removal of the old “Show Related Plans” mode and removal of generic bullet marketing content from plan cards cannot be fully verified from the provided snippets.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Remove the current “Show Related Plans” browsing mode/state (no “Show Related Plans” button; no “Related Investment Plans” header mode/state) and always display the full list of plans on #/plans.",
      "reason": "PricingSection is truncated before the full plan-card rendering; the diff excerpt does not explicitly show removal of a “Show Related Plans” button or the “Related Investment Plans” header/state, nor does it show the complete rendered list behavior.",

      "requirement": "Remove the generic hard-coded marketing bullet list from plan cards and show only plan-relevant text including plan.aiNarrative.",
      "reason": "The provided PricingSection excerpt is truncated before the card content, so it does not show whether the hard-coded bullets were removed or whether plan.aiNarrative is rendered in each plan card.",

      "requirement": "Each plan card includes a clearly labeled “Start Invest” button, and the flow includes selecting/confirming the plan, entering amount, reviewing summary, confirming purchase, plus visible success and cancel/close actions returning to the plans list.",
      "reason": "PricingSection’s card UI is truncated before button rendering; StartInvestFlowDialog shows step state and closing logic, but the excerpt is truncated before the footer/actions and review/summary UI, so the presence of a visible cancel button and complete review/confirm UI cannot be confirmed from the snippet alone.",
